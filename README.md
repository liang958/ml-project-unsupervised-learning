# Machine_Learning_Project-Unsupervised-Learning

## Project Goals
Perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis

## Process
1. Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing
1) Import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables
2) Handle missing values and outliers
3) Perform feature engineering as needed
2. KMeans clustering
3. Hierarchical clustering
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Results
1. Dataset has 20-40 numbers of outlier for each column
2. K-Mean clustering presents 4 clustering for best solution
3. Hierarchical clustering presents 2 clustering solution
4. PCA performs six dimensions reduction to three dimensions
