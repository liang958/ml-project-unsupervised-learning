# Machine_Learning_Project-Unsupervised-Learning

## Project Goals
Perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis

## Process
1. Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing
-  Import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables
-  Handle missing values and outliers
-  Perform feature engineering as needed
2. KMeans clustering
3. Hierarchical clustering
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Results
1. Dataset has 20-40 numbers of outlier for each column
2. K-Mean clustering presents 4 clustering for best solution
3. Hierarchical clustering presents 2 clustering solution
4. PCA performs six dimensions reduction to three dimensions
